## This file contains 2 functions which allow the user to save the inverse of
## a matrix in the cache. If the matrix hasn't changed then it retrieves the 
## cached matrix.


# Function: `makeCacheMatrix` creates a special "matrix" object
# that caches its inverse.

# Function `cacheSolve` computes the inverse of the special
# "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
# already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
# `cacheSolve` retrieves the inverse from the cache.
